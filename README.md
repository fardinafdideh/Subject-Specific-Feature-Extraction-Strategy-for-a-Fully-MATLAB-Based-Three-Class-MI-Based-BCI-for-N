# Subject-specific Feature Extraction Strategy for a Fully MATLAB-Based Three Class MI-Based BCI for Navigation in a Virtual Home
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a system to assist the disabled people by creating a new communication channel
between brain and computer. BCI can be designed based on various electrophysiological sources. Motor Imagery (MI)-based BCI
enables users with motor disabilities to communicate with environment in a more natural way. Subject training in a MI-based BCI is an
important factor. For this purpose various bio-feedbacks have been used in BCI research area. In this work we show how a user can
navigate in a virtual home after cue-based training with feedback and applying subject-specific feature extraction strategy. The task of
the subject in the virtual home is to perform left hand, right hand and feet motor imagery to navigate from the start station to the end
station as quick as possible. The total BCI and virtual environment is MATLAB-based and control signals are generated by analyzing
three bipolar channels only.
